consider both status and clstat in quorum check and stomith? -- split
off as separate isalive() function?

- documentation in progress; about 25% correct, 25% wrong, 50% missing
- it currently spits out debug messages every few seconds
- quorum counting accidentally counts nodes that are up but not running
  OpenMosix::HA; easy fix
    

finish mosha

stomith test 7 failed on node21

write monitor test cases

make quorum count persistent -- store on disk

detect INITTAB_NOK

clean up and make uniform PASS/PASSED/FAIL/FAILED in HA and Init
