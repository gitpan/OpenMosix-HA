consider both status and clstat in quorum check and stomith -- split
off as separate isalive() function

- documentation in progress; about 25% correct, 25% wrong, 50% missing
- it currently spits out debug messages every few seconds
- CPAN-testers report one line of code (a scalar dereference in a
  'my')
  that is not Perl 5.8 compliant; easy fix
- quorum counting accidentally nodes that are up but not running
  OpenMosix::HA; easy fix
    

finish mosha

stomith test 7 failed on node21

write monitor test cases

make quorum count persistent -- store on disk

detect INITTAB_NOK

clean up and make uniform PASS/PASSED/FAIL/FAILED in HA and Init
